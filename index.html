        <h2>Purpose and Context:</h2>
        <p>Pokepedia is a web application that serves as a Pokédex, displaying a list of 200 Pokémon. Developed as a personal project, it demonstrates my skills in front-end web development and working with external APIs.</p>

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of the project was to create an interactive and user-friendly Pokémon index. The app allows users to view detailed information about each Pokémon by clicking on their respective buttons.</p>

        <h2>Credits:</h2>
        <p>This project was undertaken solely by me as the developer. While I utilized various resources and documentation, all aspects of development were handled independently.</p>

        <h2>Duration:</h2>
        <p>The project was completed over a span of two weeks, focusing on front-end development and integration with the Pokémon API.</p>

        <h2>
